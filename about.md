# About me

My name is Ãžorleifur Bjarnason. (Thorleifur Bjarnason). I have been working in Software Development and Project Management since 1987. 
My first involvement with computers and programing was 1981 or 1982. I can say that it was not love at first sight. 
The problem was lack of computers at my school when I started to learn programming, and I found the material dull and kind of pointless.
In my last year, the school had bought lot of [BBC computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro), so I could spend more time in experimenting with programming. 
I figured out that this was probably something I would make as profession, so I learned BS in computer science.
I have always learned more by experimenting rather than following books or directions.

Currently I am Divisional Manager at [Advania](https://www.advania.com) in Iceland. My main work is Integration Projects between systems.
